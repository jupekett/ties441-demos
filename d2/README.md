# TIES441 - Demo 2 - Exercise 2.5

In this exercise I implemented a car counter in four (WIP) distinct architectural styles:
- OBJECTS that communicate together without a centralized flow of control,
- MESSAGE BUS, through with components communicate,
- (LAYERS that are distinquished by their location on the spectrum of "general -> domain specific"),
- (BLACKBOARD, where data is centralized to one entity)

## Installation

```
npm install
tsc
```

WIP - needs a startup script
